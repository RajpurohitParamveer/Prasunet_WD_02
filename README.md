#Stop-Watch WebApplication

Project Overview As a web development intern at Prasunet Pvt. Ltd., I developed a modern and premium-looking Stopwatch Web Application. This project involved creating a responsive and interactive web application that allows users to start, stop, and reset a timer. The application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging advanced CSS techniques for styling and providing an enhanced user experience.

Features Implemented

User Interface Design:

Created a visually appealing UI using modern design principles, including a gradient background, semi-transparent containers, and smooth transitions. Implemented responsive design to ensure the application works well on various screen sizes.

Functionality:

Developed core stopwatch functionality to start, stop, and reset the timer. Used JavaScript to manage the timer logic, including calculating elapsed time and updating the display in real-time.

Interactivity:

Added hover effects and animations to buttons for a more interactive user experience. Ensured that the UI updates dynamically based on the state of the stopwatch (running or stopped).

Technologies and Libraries Used

HTML5: Used for structuring the content and providing the skeleton of the application.

CSS3: Utilized for styling the application, including Flexbox for layout, CSS Grid for responsive design, and advanced CSS features for animations and transitions.

JavaScript (ES6): Implemented the logic for the stopwatch functionality, including event handling and DOM manipulation.

Google Fonts: Integrated to use the ‘Roboto’ font for a clean and modern typography.

Live Server Extension (VS Code): Used to run a local development server with live reload capability, facilitating efficient development and testing.

Learning Outcomes

Problem-Solving:

Encountered and resolved various challenges related to timer logic and UI updates. Gained experience in debugging and testing to ensure the application runs smoothly. This project not only improved my technical skills but also provided valuable experience in delivering a polished and functional web application.
